    aboutIntro: 'This application is a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the management of tool defects, asset tracking, and ownership handovers. It provides a centralized platform for technicians, supervisors, and administrators to maintain an accurate inventory and efficiently handle the entire lifecycle of tools and equipment.',
    aboutFeaturesTitle: 'Key Features',
    aboutDashboardTitle: 'Dashboard',
    aboutDashboardDesc: 'Get an instant overview of your tool inventory. The dashboard displays key metrics such as total tools, items currently in service, defective tools, and assets requiring an audit.',
    aboutDefectReportTitle: 'Defect Reporting',
    aboutDefectReportDesc: 'Create detailed defect reports by selecting multiple tools assigned to a specific owner. Classify the defect type as "Misuse" or "Wear and Tear". Submitted reports enter a formal approval workflow.',
    aboutApprovalsTitle: 'Approvals Workflow',
    aboutApprovalsDesc: 'Supervisors and Admins can review, approve, or reject submitted defect reports. Approving a report updates the status of the tools in the database (e.g., to "Scrap" or "Repairable"), while rejecting it reverts the tools to their previous state. Technicians must attach a photo to their reports, which is visible during the approval process.',
    aboutToolAuditTitle: 'Tool Auditing',
    aboutToolAuditDesc: 'A dedicated module to track and perform scheduled tool audits. The system flags tools that are due for an audit, and authorized users can record audit details, which automatically updates the tool\'s audit history and schedules the next one.',
    aboutHandoverTitle: 'Tool Handover',
    aboutHandoverDesc: 'Securely manage the transfer of tools between owners. The handover module creates a printable document and updates the tool\'s ownership details in the database upon confirmation.',
    aboutDatabaseTitle: 'Database Management',
    aboutDatabaseDesc: 'A centralized database for all Tools, Owners, and Application Users. Admins have full control, including inline editing of records, bulk data import/export via CSV, and syncing tool data with the owners database to ensure consistency.',
    aboutExportTitle: 'Data Export',
    aboutExportDesc: 'Easily export your data from the Tools, Owners, or App Users databases into a CSV file for offline analysis, reporting, or backup.',
    aboutAITitle: 'AI-Powered Suggestions',
    aboutAIDesc: 'Leverage the power of AI to analyze defect descriptions. When creating a report, use the "Get AI Suggestion" feature to automatically recommend a status (e.g., Repairable, Scrap) and a course of action.',
